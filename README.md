[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/registrie?color=red&logo=npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/registrie)


I am actively contributing to Higuma Soft, where I develop a package called Registry. This package will serve as a critical dependency in Prompt-UI, a tool that generate UI resembles bash prompt. Key details about the project:

Development Highlights:
Creating a flexible and generic registry system that manages storing users data
Integrating it into larger projects with a modular approach, ensuring high reusability and extensibility.
Stay tuned for more on this project as we move toward our release!
